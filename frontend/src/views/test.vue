    Our partnership began in February 2023, and since then, we’ve completed over
    25 photo sessions and two video shoots. We focused on capturing authentic
    moments – from live concerts in the iconic Pitstop venue to workshops where
    local artists shared their skills, like leather crafting, ceramics, or
    portrait photography. Each time, we faced the challenge of adapting to
    different environments and capturing the true spirit of these events.

    Our work enhanced the visitor experience by providing them with photos of
    their involvement at Huset Fundament, creating a collection for crowdfunding
    campaigns, and attracting more artists to this unique community. For us, it
    wasn’t just work, but a real connection with artists, creators, and their
    stories.

    Working in the theatre and capturing artistic works, especially
    autobiographical ones, is always a rewarding challenge. We are passionate
    about bringing unique stories to life through visual media, and this
    collaboration was truly inspiring. We look forward to documenting more new
    artistic visions!
