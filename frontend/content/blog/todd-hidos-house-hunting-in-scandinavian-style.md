I borrowed the concept of *House Hunting* from the inspiring photographer and artist [Todd Hido](http://www.toddhido.com/). However, our motivations and final products differ significantly. My goal was to combine Urbex, my love of charming Scandinavian architecture, the [Cheap Old Houses](https://www.instagram.com/CHEAPOLDHOUSES/) project, and Hido's narrative style of documenting the past by capturing the current state or remnants of abandoned buildings.

In the past, I tried several times to apply the inspiration I gained from Hido's works to lonely constructions in Czechia and Denmark.

Even though the exterior atmosphere was slightly more matching to the one that Hido works with—lonely lights, night, and fog often captured through long exposure on a medium format camera—I felt that this time I was the closest to Hido's world.

On one of my walks in the neighbourhood of Palosaari, in Finnish Vaasa, I couldn't help but notice the beautiful pale green colour of a low-key, old-fashioned family house. Upon closer inspection, I saw broken windows and a damaged entrance staircase, indicating that the building was uninhabited. The building immediately sparked my photographer's instinct, and I saw an opportunity to experiment with new elements in a style I had been working with.

Beforehand, I contacted the city planning department to gather information about the property. We discovered that the building was marked for demolition, so my initial plan of taking photos to be used by the *Cheap Old Houses* initiative to save the building was dashed. However, there is still hope as the Ostrobothnian Museum will likely be consulted before a demolition permit is issued due to the building's age and potential historical value.

With the owner's permission, my friend and fellow photographer [Samuli](https://www.instagram.com/samuliframes/) and I agreed to photograph the inside of the building at sunrise on an early autumn morning.:brWe were able to explore the interior of the building and photograph the bleached spots on the walls, likely left by previously hanging frames and paintings. Despite the building's impending demolition, we were able to document its beauty and history through our photography.
