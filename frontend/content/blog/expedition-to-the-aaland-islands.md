The Åland Islands are autonomously demilitarized territories under Finnish jurisdiction. They have their government, flag, and historical heritage and are exempt from Finnish conscription. Although the western shore of the mainland is bilingual (Swedish and Finnish), the Åland Islands are entirely Swedish-speaking.

The Åland Islands are autonomously demilitarized territories under Finnish jurisdiction. They have their government, flag, and historical heritage and are exempt from Finnish conscription. Although the western shore of the mainland is bilingual (Swedish and Finnish), the Åland Islands are entirely Swedish-speaking.

I had been planning an expedition to the *land of ål* ([eel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eel)) since my arrival in Finland. In mid-October 2022, during the Autumn break, my friend Andreas, from Swedish Dalarna, and I decided to take a ferry from the Finnish coastal town of [Turku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turku) (Åbo in Swedish). However, we had to stay overnight in Turku due to train connections from our hometown of [Vaasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaasa) not matching the early ferry departure time.

For the first few hours of our cruise, we navigated through hundreds of skerries as we sailed through the densest area of the [Archipelago Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago_Sea). This area, approximately *8300 square kilometers* in size, is home to around *50,000 archipelagos* and tiny rocky islands (skerries). It is considered one of the largest areas by the number of archipelagos in the world and is truly an interesting sight to behold.

After disembarking from the Baltic Princess in [Mariehamn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariehamn), the capital of the Åland Islands, we met our third adventure seeker, Marcel. We resupplied our groceries and liquids in Åland's capital and the largest city before starting our journey of discovery from south to north. We followed a rule of thumb to take a short break every 45–60 minutes to stretch, eat some sugar or protein, and hydrate. This helped us to maintain our performance and motivation over the long haul.

The following day we woke up in our bushcraft camp on the banks of Lake Långsjön. Right in the morning we had to change our plans when we learned that the local ferry we were supposed to take back from the north tip of the islands only operates during the summer.

:br

Our original plan to walk over 100 km in five days, from south to north through the eastern hemisphere of the most inhabited island, [Fasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasta_%C3%85land), and return through the western hemisphere, was changed to hitchhiking and seeing as much as possible. We were able to reach the Djupviksgrottan cave by the evening of the second day with the help of two hitchhiking rides.

After saying goodbye to our last ferryman, we embarked on a journey through the western part of the islands. We walked and hitchhiked along the coast, taking in the beautiful scenery and meeting friendly locals. One of the highlights of the trip was visiting the lighthouse at the north tip of the islands. On the way back, we stopped at the church in Jomala, where we saw the graves of sailors who died at sea.

Before leaving the cave, Marcel and I scouted the surrounding countryside and were surprised to discover fancy-looking and well-equipped cottages just a few hundred meters above the cave, seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Later that day, we were back on our feet, walking on the red roads that are common on the Åland Islands, passing rural settlements and farms, and seeking rides once again.

This time, our carriers were two fresh-looking wanderers we had talked with earlier that day in the cave (the only males who stopped for us during our entire journey!). We exchanged stories and tips with strangers in their cars, squeezed into the rear seats. On our way to the capital in the south, our paths split in Godby. As before, we resupplied with groceries, recharged our lithium batteries, chilled in the lobby, and reviewed our strategy.

It was just the second day of our expedition, and we had already reached our final destination. We decided to conquer the east of the archipelago territory as a plan for our remaining two days. To our disappointment, as soon as we finished our planning and got ready to continue, a violent storm with intense rain occurred. Despite fate's unwillingness, we proceeded further into darkness, far away from the city lights, still hoping for a ride.

After an hour of struggling to attract passing drivers with smiles and hand waves, when it seemed that Ålanders were cold-hearted and without mercy for trespassing foreigners, a Nissan unnoticed our presence pulled over a few dozen meters away. As soon as we realized what had happened, we sprinted towards the car cheering. The lonely driver, Karolina, offered us hot tea and a promise of warming up in her nearby house.

Later that evening we met most likely her entire family including cats, dogs, and chickens. Karolina's tribe made all of us wanderers feel as welcome as being back home and still being thousands of kilometers far away. The original tea break extended into a deep discussion and storytelling over dinner, with stoves heating our backs, with Karolina, the head of the tribe, Thomas, and their daughter Frida. When Andreas, Marcel, and I agreed that our hosts were truly generous to strangers, we were offered a sleepover (and bed!) and the keys to their car for the following day. We humbly accepted the given offerings and went to sleep like babies. Our third day began with the sound of the family's rooster and with both homemade yogurt and eggs.

Karolina advised us to scout the island of Prästo, which is among the locals prominent due to several [historical graveyards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%A4st%C3%B6,_%C3%85land#History) – Jewish, Muslim, and Christian ones. When we wandered around this truly spiritual archipelago and had a remarkable land view of our surroundings from a nearby tower and cuddled with a flock of curious sheep, we returned to our temporary basecamp to borrow a car and wander further east, over the red roads, which were from time to time replaced by car ferries, to the end of the road on [Vårdö](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A5rd%C3%B6).

There are tiny stacks of small boulders on the top of each gravestone, as a symbol of respect and remembrance.](https://cdn.slavic.media/img/graveyards/4K "2022 ⋅ Prastö, Åland")


Our afternoon was spent in the spirit of attempts to fish in the crystal-clear water of an empty fishing village on the tip of Vårdö and swim in the October-cold [Åland Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_%C3%85land). Although you could count the days we spent together on the fingers of one hand, when it came time for goodbye to our hosts in the evening, it felt like leaving a good old friend after a long time of not seeing each other. Despite not having an opportunity to repay the generosity of the family who took us in, I couldn't help but think that they were simply repaying a debt to someone else. The idea is that if I provide for others, my debt to the universe will be repaid and someone else will be treated with kindness.

Our final task was to make it back to Mariehamn. We had no luck with hitchhiking, so after several hours of hiking through the empty red roads, we reached Godby, about 17 km away, in the night and set up camp using a tarp on the banks of Lake Långsjön, like the first night. The final day was spent with the goal of reaching Mariehamn in the evening and spending the last night in the forest between the city and the seashore.

Despite feeling like we had overcome all obstacles, the last one was the rain that lasted throughout the night. Marcel, who slept under the open sky in just a sleeping bag, was especially hard hit and was soaked in the morning. My [bivak bag](https://gobagguide.com/bivy-bag/) protected me from most of the rain, but some still got in. Andreas, who had wisely set up a modest tent using his tarp, was the driest of us in the morning. Unfortunately, the tarp tent did not cover his feet and the large open entrance allowed the rain to get in. On the final morning, we compared our level of wetness and said goodbye. Marcel travelled back to Denmark via Stockholm, while Andreas and I returned to Turku, Finland.
