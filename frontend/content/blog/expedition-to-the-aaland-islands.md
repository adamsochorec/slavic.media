The Åland Islands are autonomously demilitarized territories under Finnish jurisdiction. They have their government, flag, and historical heritage and are exempt from Finnish conscription. Although the western shore of the mainland is bilingual (Swedish and Finnish), the Åland Islands are entirely Swedish-speaking.
