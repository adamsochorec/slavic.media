We had the unique opportunity to be part of the “Friskabe” performance, directed by the talented [Kim Kim](https://www.kimkimyes.com) at [Sort/Hvid Theatre](https://sort-hvid.dk) in Copenhagen earlier this summer. After our previous collaboration at the [Roskilde Festival](https://www.roskilde-festival.dk), Kim invited us to capture and document this piece.

“Friskabe” is a fascinating adaptation of the book “The Ship,” where Kim masterfully connects his personal experiences with the story, performing a profound and unique dimension. Together with singer Henriette Sennenvaldt from the band ‌UNDER BYEN, they created a captivating musical and visual atmosphere that our cameras enthusiastically captured.

Our visual documentation was supported by unique props: a fountain made of wine glasses, a giant plaster cake (referring to the famous Danish artist [Michael Kvium](https://www.michaelkvium.com)), an enormous screen projection, a sandbox, a swing, and more.

Working in the theatre and capturing artistic works, especially autobiographical ones, is always a rewarding challenge. We are passionate about bringing unique stories to life through visual media, and this collaboration was truly inspiring. We look forward to documenting more new artistic visions!
