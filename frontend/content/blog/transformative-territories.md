Last summer, I had the opportunity to work on a pro bono agroforestry project for [ArtMill Gallery](https://artmill.eu)—a volunteer-driven centre focused on regenerative art and ecology. Using the DJI drone at Slavic Media in combination with [DroneDeploy](https://dronedeploy.com/) software, we successfully created a high-resolution 3D model of ArtMill’s landscape, capturing topography and plant health profiles.

This project was also a chance to test a new skill set I developed after completing a [DroneDeploy](https://dronedeploy.com/) course, which taught me their tools and techniques for terrain mapping.

## The Mapping Process

To generate an accurate 3D representation, the drone followed a meticulously planned flight pattern. Several flights were conducted across the property, each capturing a sequence of high-resolution images at predefined intervals. The flight path was structured in a cross-grid pattern, ensuring comprehensive coverage from multiple angles.

Images were taken at two key angles: 90° (straight-down, nadir view) and 45° (oblique view). This combination allowed us to capture both topographical details and structural depth, enhancing the overall accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.

## Processing & Results

Once all images were collected, they were processed in [DroneDeploy](https://dronedeploy.com/), which stitched the photos together into a detailed 3D mesh. Despite not using high-end RTK/PTK modules, this method—relying solely on advanced image processing—proved to be a cost-effective and highly practical solution for topographical mapping.

The final model provides a detailed visual representation of the terrain, offering valuable insights for agroforestry planning and ecological studies.
