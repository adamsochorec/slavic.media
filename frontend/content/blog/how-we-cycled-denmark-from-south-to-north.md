At some point, Marcel and I decided to bike from [Flensburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flensburg) in Germany to [Skagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skagen) in Denmark along the [Jutland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jutland) peninsula's west coast. It was an unforgettable journey.

We traveled over 570 km in 10 days along the Danish national cycle route 1, also known as [Vestkystruten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_National_Cycle_Route_1), capturing stunning views of Denmark. Our route included nights in public shelters and forests, swimming in the chilly North Sea, and exploring inland fjords.

From coastal vistas to quaint towns, the journey had it all. Our destination, Skagen, offered a unique sight where the North Sea meets the Baltic Sea.
