On the 12th of April, I woke up early and packed a backpack with lunch before heading to the Kolding train station. I took a train to Oksbøl, which is located near Blåvand, the westernmost city in Denmark. My plan was to visit the [Blåvand Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl%C3%A5vand_Lighthouse), about a 35-minute walk from the bus station. At the time, Blåvand was hosting a festival, and the main road through the city was congested with cars with Danish and German license plates.

I stopped at a local fisherman's shop to buy a shrimp salad from a bakery and began walking. The town center of Blåvand is not large, and it wasn't long before I reached an area with dozens of summer houses surrounded by pine trees. As I neared the shore, the vacation homes gave way to standalone houses built in the dunes a few meters from the sea.

According to my navigation app, I had about 20 minutes left on my walk. As I walked along the North Sea shore, I headed slightly north to follow the 400 km-long west coast that borders Germany to the south and flows into the Baltic Sea at [Skagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skagen) to the north. The westernmost point of Denmark, [Blåvandshuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bl%C3%A5vandshuk), was filled with the sounds of waves crashing and seagulls screeching, as well as children playing on the WWII bunkers built as part of the [Atlantic Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Wall) during the war.

I noticed that these bunkers were spaced about every few hundred meters along the entire west coast. However, 'standing' might not be the right term to describe their condition. After more than half a century of neglect in the sand, these bunkers had sunken into the ground. Their exteriors were often covered in graffiti, and some even had additional metal constructions shaped like horses or giraffes. As I passed more and more bunkers, each with its unique design and level of deterioration, I had the idea to scan them using a 3D modeling app called [Polycam](https://poly.cam).

While the app's scanning and processing options are not the most advanced, it is user-friendly and convenient to use. There are also several ways to use the app for free, such as creating user profiles and sharing scanned content.

When I reached the lighthouse, I bought a ticket to the top of the tower from a small house that was probably used to house the lighthouse crew. The view from the top was surreal, with dunes covered in grass of varying colors and narrow paths running through them. The landscape reminded me of the planet [Scarif](https://www.starwars.com/databank/scarif) from Star Wars.

Later, as I browsed the souvenir shop, I saw a large selection of [amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber) necklaces and jewelry. The elderly woman behind the cashier's desk told me that with a bit of luck, I might be able to find some amber on the beach. As I walked along the west coast, I noticed that the Danish military liked to train in the stratified terrain in the area surrounding Blåvand. The beach and sand fields to the northeast had several watchtowers, as well as other military facilities such as antennas and small storage units. Yellow signs warned of military areas, and fencing marked off the training grounds.

Overall, my visit to Blåvand was a unique and memorable experience. The WWII bunkers, now used as playgrounds by children, were a poignant reminder of the past, and the natural beauty of the west coast was breathtaking. In addition, I would also recommend visiting nearby Bjarke Ingels's [Tirpitz museum](https://tirpitz.dk/).
