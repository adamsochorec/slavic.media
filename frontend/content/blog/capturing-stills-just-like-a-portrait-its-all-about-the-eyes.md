A mentor once told me that every powerful image or film thrives on eye contact. Back then, I was more interested in capturing non-human objects. But as my work shifted to working with people, I started to see how impactful a deep, authentic gaze could be.

Directing models or actors in the studio can be challenging. They expect confidence and direction, and I’m still working on mastering that part. Every session teaches me something new.

When studio sessions fall short, I capture raw, unfiltered moments. Trading the control of a studio for the energy of live settings—whether at a theatre rehearsal, a crowded Pitstop, or a festival stage at [Roskilde Festival](https://roskilde-festival.dk)—has led to some of my favourite shots. Performers lost in their world create an authenticity that can’t be directed.

Being up close, equipped with the right lens, and capturing spontaneity in motion creates striking images. These moments feel so intentional, that you’d hardly believe they emerged from the chaos of live performance.
