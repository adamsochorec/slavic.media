Recently, I had the pleasure of working with [RXDevents](https://www.rxd.dk) on a [CrossFit](https://crossfitpitstop.dk) competition. I took over 6000 photos in two days, which never happened to me before, but there were a couple of shots I could not stop looking at, despite the mass of the rest, and that's what I would like to talk about.<br><br>
It has been a while since I saw the movie [Tatami](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26674818/?ref_=nm_ov_bio_lk), directed by [Zar Amir Ebrahimi](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4399355/?ref_=tt_ov_dr_1) and [Guy Nattiv](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1142235/?ref_=tt_ov_dr_2). The movie is about the Iranian female judoka Leila, who is competing in the World Judo Championships and is intent on bringing home Iran's first gold medal.

From a visual perspective, the black-and-white design, light work, and contrast were terrific. When I looked at some shots from the competition, I immediately knew I had the opportunity to create something with similar energy and format. This brings me to another point I would like to stress: creatively working with inspiration.

Similarly, like in web design, many great things come up when playing around with knowledge of established, tested, and proven principles, together with some kind of inner motivation and inspiration. Why try to invent the wheel every time? Just like borrowing the visual concept of _Tatami_ and flexing it according to my very own vision, to [make your kind of music](https://open.spotify.com/track/6H3Wa6hWR9DRMzMSd4pZkT?si=a182d7d39a1a4f21).
