It’s all about how light and colour interact. For example, when a strong source of red and blue light are close together, they blend and cast a completely purple light instead of staying distinct.

This phenomenon happens because red and blue are two parts of the digital colour scale, RGB (Red, Green, Blue), which in different proportions can create millions of colour combinations.

There are 16,777,216 possible colours when you combine these three colours at different intensity levels, each ranging from 0 to 255. Understanding the fundamentals of the colour spectrum is key to working with colours in both post-production and light design, something we focus on for every project at Slavic Media.
