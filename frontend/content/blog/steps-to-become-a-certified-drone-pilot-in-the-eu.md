Have you ever wondered if there are any rules for flying drones? In the EU, flying a drone with a camera involves more than just manoeuvring through the skies—it’s about flying safely and legally. Here’s what you need to know:

### 1. Registration & Insurance

Every drone (UAV or UAS) with a camera must be registered with your local aviation authority and have valid liability insurance—just like your car!

### 2. Pilot License

You’ll need a valid drone pilot license to fly legally. For drones under 500g, start with the A1/A3 competency test, which can be done online. This is an easy way to get started in drone piloting.

### 3. Advanced Certification

If your drone weighs more than 500g, you’ll need the A2 test, which covers more advanced topics (more in-depth legal, basics of meteorology and aerodynamics). While the test can still be done online, it requires supervision at a local test centre—like [Erhvervsakademi SydVest (Business Academy South West)](https://easv.dk), where both myself and colleague Marcel got certified for just an administration fee (60 DKK)!
