We launched the first project with Timetravels Ltd and Slavic Media in Swedish Lapland a year from now. Our collaboration quickly became one of the most impactful partnerships in Marcel Hájik's and my journey as content creators. From above the Arctic Circle to the fjords of Norway, here’s what we learned along the way.

## 1. Seize Opportunities & Be Proactive

This collaboration began because we reached out. Inspired by an experience with Timetravels during my student exchange, we approached their marketing team with a proposal to create content across destinations. Taking that first step led to a lasting partnership and showed us the power of initiative and seizing opportunities.

## 2. Adaptability is Everything

Our first assignment with Timetravels was in Björkliden in Swedish Lapland. With limited resources (we borrowed most of our equipment), we faced arctic conditions and tight schedules. This experience taught us to stay adaptable and resourceful. We developed production pipelines on the go, balancing filming with the opportunity to immerse ourselves in the Lapland experience.

## 4. Authenticity Drives Storytelling

Working alongside local guides and experiencing the lifestyle firsthand taught us the value of capturing authentic interactions. From husky sledding to the quiet moments in the sauna, our goal was to showcase the spirit of Lapland’s landscape and people in the most genuine way possible. This authenticity resonated with the client and helped establish the connection that led to more projects.

## 4. Building Strong Client Relationships

Our pilot video marked a turning point in our collaboration. Timetravels’ positive response to our work solidified our partnership and led to further assignments in Finnish Lapland and Norway. Through continuous feedback and project reviews, we developed patience and understanding, essential skills when working with clients remotely.

## 5 Developing a Professional Workflow on the Go

This collaboration pushed us to establish structured workflows, even under challenging conditions. We learned to manage remote teamwork, project reviews, and client requests effectively, building processes that allow us to deliver high-quality content on tight timelines.

## 6 The Importance of Community and Positive Impact

From working with passionate guides to meeting people along our journey, this partnership reminded us that meaningful travel content is built on human connections. Working with Timetravels allowed us to create content that isn’t just engaging but also highlights the integrity of shared experiences and company culture.

Timetravels was our first major client, and our work felt valuable. This collaboration strengthened our skills, built our portfolio, and allowed us to explore new depths of storytelling in the travel industry. We’re grateful for the chance to show our best, find out our limits and gain some sisu. Thank you for believing in Slavic Media power!
