As the autumn days began, I had the opportunity to visit the Västerbotten province in Sweden during my exchange program at [Vaasan Ylipsto](https://www.uwasa.fi/). My Swedish classmate, Andreas, invited me to stay with his friend in the province, which is located on the east side of Sweden. Westrobothnia, or Västerbotten in Sweden, is one of the 21 counties in Sweden and its administrative centre is located in Umeå. The Finnish city of Vaasa, where my university is located, and Umeå are connected by a 4-hour ferry ride across the narrowest part of the Bothnian Bay.

As it was my first time in Sweden, I had high expectations for the countryside and the way Swedes handle [Everyman's right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam#Sweden). These were the focus of our trip for the next four days.

:br

We arrived in Umeå on September 1st and were greeted warmly by our hosts. After a Czech-Swedish introduction and some trouble finding our car at the dock, we began our drive to the small inland village of Bullmark. On the way out of the city, we passed a sawmill complex, which was accompanied by the pleasant smell of processed wood. If someone were to tell me afterwards that you can't smell a picture, I would disagree.

In the evening, we settled down and had dinner at Joakim's apartment, which was located next to the forest. The apartment was best described as a shipping container with a classical Nordic facade made out of red [falu rödfärg](https://falurodfarg.com/en/about-us/) planks and white outlines around windows and edges. Our host, Joakim, belonged to the [Sámi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A1mi) family, the native inhabitants of Scandinavia who still live in the forests of Lapland and primarily herd [reindeer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reindeer). His apartment was full of family heritage, including historical furniture, reindeer trophies, and traditional hand-crafted knives of various sizes.

Later that night, we decided to sleep in the surrounding forest. The essence of the Everyman's right is that one can sleep, pick berries and mushrooms, and set a campfire almost anywhere, with the exception of private properties and national parks. This right to roam exists in several other countries besides Finland and Sweden. We set up camp under the bare sky in a [bivak bag](https://gobagguide.com/bivy-bag/) and Andreas and Joakim under a stretched tarp among the trees.

:br

Surrounded by berries and young pine forest, the trees were planted so regularly that you could see a solid distance in any direction, which made me think that something wasn't quite right about it. I thought about this while being bored during an online lecture the following morning.

:br

After my programming lecture ended, the boys were already preparing a light breakfast of porridge and tea. We also made sure to properly extinguish the campfire and headed out to find a nearby spiritual stone formations from ancient times.

:br

After an hour of searching, we realized that the stones were not in the location we thought they were, so we headed back home with a few chanterelle mushrooms we had found in our pockets.

:br

In addition to bush crafting, we also attended a free induction lecture on [Brazilian jiu-jitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu) at a [Umeå Kampcenter](http://www.umeakampcenter.se) later that day.

The martial arts lecture sparked our interest in continuing to test our strengths even after returning to Bullmark. Joakim had two pairs of hand-guards for sparring from his [MMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts) period, so we conducted a modest sparring session on a rocky parking lot behind his house.

:br

During the session, we shared our various combat experiences from boxing, MMA, to [Taekwondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo). The following morning was dedicated to fishing and searching for mushrooms around the nearby river. However, we were not successful in either activity, catching no fish and only finding three boletus.

:br

Despite our unsuccessful morning hunt, we had an exciting plan for the rest of the day: proper [bushcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushcraft). We headed to a countryside location a dozen kilometres south of Bullmark. As we drove deeper into the forest, we encountered a hunter's watch that was keeping an eye on the group's belongings, mainly consisting of several large pickups parked by the road. This meant we would be sharing the woods with hunters during hunting season, and according to my friends, they don't usually respect others' right to wander in the landscape during this time.

When we reached the end of the dirt road, we took our gear and Emil's husky, Barnabas, and walked through the mixed woods. As soon as we passed through the wall of trees, we could see the subject of our interest: a mire lake that was semi-cut throughout by a heap of tentacles, which were solid enough to walk on. We followed the tentacle-shaped ground to its tip, where we decided to set up camp.

:br

The boys set up a tarp 45 degrees over a rope between the pines to create a single-sided shelter. Emil decided to sleep in a hammock. The first thing we did upon arriving at the campsite was to set up a reflective west on a tall pine tree around our campsite—so the hunters could see our position.

Right after setting up camp, light rain began and we had a chance to test our shelter. As I sat under the tarp, I observed how the sunny day transformed into a cloudy rainstorm, then into a sunny afternoon followed by a wall of fog that evaporated from the bog, and was later cut through by sunset rays.

:br

I felt the immediate power of nature around me and realized that going into the forest and doing primitive but fulfilling activities, that mankind has been doing for most of its existence, helped me understand the complex matrix of the contemporary world in which I often feel confused by numerous procedures or cultural habits that are not always clear. It felt like going back in time through the history of mankind and at the same time looking at the world from a simpler, more connected perspective.

:br

In the evening, we fried meat over an open fire and told each other stories from our countries, families, and lives. In the middle of the night, a strong wind woke me up. Through the fog, stars, and dew-covered branches, I could see something I had never seen before—the magical Northern Lights.

Their shapes danced above the mire lake and reflected in the water. The experience was both tranquil and awe-inspiring.

It was the perfect ending to our trip.
