That’s one of the first things we heard when we introduced Slavic Media in Denmark. The name provoked uncomfortable reactions and raised eyebrows.

> "Why associate yourself with a culture that has a negative reputation?" :br "Slavic, isn't that risky?"

For us, Slavic Media was a celebration of our roots—Czechia and Slovakia. It represents authenticity, hard work, honesty, and a deep respect for nature—values we proudly uphold. But not everyone saw it that way…

:br

There were moments when we considered changing the name. But then we asked ourselves—why should we?

:br

Slavic Media isn’t just a name. It’s a statement of pride. We stand against stereotypes and prove that where we come from doesn’t define us—our actions and values do.

:br

Despite the challenges, we’ve stayed true to our identity. Slavic Media I/S is more than a brand—it’s rooted in integrity, respect for the environment, and quality, no matter the perceptions.

Here’s to staying true to who we are.
